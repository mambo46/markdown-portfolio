<h1> I think this syntax might be easier than HTML... Why?<h1>
  1. because you can enter lists like you would on word
  2. don't have to remember the syntax
      1. they are usually abbreviated so sometimes if you haven't used them in a while you can forget them
  
 <h2> another list undordered this time <h2> 
  * interesting way to do unordered
  * I like the simplicity but hopefully does'nt get confusing
